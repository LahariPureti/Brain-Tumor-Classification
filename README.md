# Brain-Tumor-Classification
Brain Tumor Classification using Deep Learning

This project focuses on building an AI-powered brain tumor classification system that leverages Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to detect and classify brain tumors from MRI images.

Project Overview

Brain tumors pose a serious health risk, and early detection is crucial for effective treatment. Traditional diagnosis relies on manual analysis of MRI scans, which can be time-consuming and prone to error. This project aims to automate the classification process by using deep learning techniques to accurately classify MRI brain images into different categories:

Glioma Tumor
Meningioma Tumor
Pituitary Tumor
No Tumor

Key Features

Image preprocessing (resizing, normalization, augmentation).
CNN-based deep learning model for feature extraction and classification.
Training and validation on publicly available brain MRI datasets.
Evaluation using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix.
Model deployment-ready for integration into real-world applications.

Dataset

The dataset consists of labeled MRI brain images, publicly available on [Kaggle / Figshare / etc.] (replace with your source).
